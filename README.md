# MLH INIT Bootsrap Starter Pack
This is a starter pack that I made while watching MLH INIT Livestream and following Jacklyn's directions.
You can clone it and it will give you a basic Bootstrap project that you can then use. Feel free to edit it as you need!

## How do I use this?
You should clone this repo (or download it as a .zip file) to your computer. If you download it as a .zip file you need to uncompress it. You can then open the folder in any code editor, including VS code and Atom.

There are lots of example files in the repo. Feel free to change or remove them!

## Useful links to get started!
